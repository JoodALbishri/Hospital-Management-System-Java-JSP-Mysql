The **Hospital Management System** developed using **Java**, **JSP**, and **MySQL** can be described through its **system architecture** by identifying its major components and how they interact. Here's a high-level description of the system architecture:

### 1. **Presentation Layer (Client Side)**
   - **Technology**: JSP (Java Server Pages), HTML, CSS, JavaScript
   - **Description**: 
     The presentation layer is responsible for the user interface and the interaction with the users (doctors, patients, administrators). It includes JSP pages that dynamically generate the front-end content based on the userâ€™s role and actions. Users can log in, view medical records, appointments, etc.
   - **Components**:
     - **Login Page**: Allows users (admin, doctors, and patients) to authenticate themselves.
     - **Dashboard**: Displays information based on the role of the user (admin dashboard, doctor dashboard, patient dashboard).
     - **Forms and Views**: For patient registration, appointment booking, viewing medical records, etc.
   
### 2. **Business Logic Layer (Middle Layer)**
   - **Technology**: Java Servlets, JSP
   - **Description**: 
     The business logic layer handles the core functionality of the hospital management system. This layer manages user requests, interacts with the database, and processes business logic. Java servlets take user inputs from the front end (JSP) and apply the necessary business rules.
   - **Components**:
     - **Controllers**: Java servlets act as controllers that manage requests from JSPs and return appropriate responses. For example, patient registration, appointment scheduling, and medical record updates.
     - **Services**: Java classes that implement the business logic, such as calculating appointment availability, managing user roles, and handling other domain-specific functionality.
     - **Session Management**: Handles user authentication and session persistence (who is logged in, session timeouts, etc.).

### 3. **Data Access Layer (DAL)**
   - **Technology**: Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), MySQL
   - **Description**:
     The data access layer communicates with the database to perform operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting data. It is the bridge between the business logic layer and the database.
   - **Components**:
     - **DAO (Data Access Objects)**: DAO classes encapsulate the logic to interact with the database using JDBC. They provide an interface for interacting with the database tables (e.g., UserDAO, AppointmentDAO, MedicalRecordDAO).
     - **Database Connection Manager**: Manages database connections and handles connection pooling, ensuring efficient communication between the system and the database.

### 4. **Database Layer**
   - **Technology**: MySQL
   - **Description**:
     The database layer stores all the data related to the hospital, including patient information, doctor schedules, appointments, and medical records.
   - **Tables**:
     - **Users Table**: Stores details for patients, doctors, and administrators.
     - **Appointments Table**: Manages scheduled appointments for patients and doctors.
     - **Medical Records Table**: Stores the medical history and records of patients.
     - **Other Tables**: For hospital resources, billing, and inventory management (if applicable).

### 5. **Interaction Between Layers**
   - **Request Flow**: 
     - The user interacts with the **presentation layer** (JSP), which sends HTTP requests to the **business logic layer** (Servlets and Services).
     - The **business logic layer** processes the request, applying business rules, and then interacts with the **data access layer** to retrieve or modify data.
     - The **data access layer** executes the necessary queries using JDBC to communicate with the **database layer** (MySQL).
     - Once the data is fetched or updated, the response is passed back up through the layers, ultimately updating the **presentation layer** with the appropriate information.
   
### 6. **Security & Authentication**
   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: The system implements role-based authentication, ensuring that only authorized users (admins, doctors, patients) have access to specific features and data.
   - **Session Management**: Managed by servlets, ensuring user sessions are valid and protected.

### Summary:
This **Hospital Management System** architecture follows a layered approach:
1. **Presentation Layer (UI/UX)**: JSP pages for user interaction.
2. **Business Logic Layer (Controller/Services)**: Handles core operations.
3. **Data Access Layer (DAO)**: Communicates with the database.
4. **Database Layer (MySQL)**: Stores data.

Each layer is decoupled, allowing for easy maintenance, scalability, and enhancement.
