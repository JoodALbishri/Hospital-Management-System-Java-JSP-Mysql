I cannot access the GitHub repository directly due to restrictions, but I can still describe a high-level system architecture for a typical Hospital Management System built with Java, JSP, and MySQL. Here’s a potential structure:

### 1. **Presentation Layer (User Interface)**
   - **Technology**: JSP (Java Server Pages)
   - **Components**: Web pages that interact with users (admin, doctors, patients, etc.)
   - **Functionality**: Handles user inputs, form submissions, and displays data to the user.

### 2. **Business Logic Layer (Application Layer)**
   - **Technology**: Java Servlets, POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects)
   - **Components**: 
     - **Servlets**: Handle HTTP requests, manage sessions, and control workflows.
     - **Business Logic Classes**: Implement the hospital's core functions, such as patient management, appointment scheduling, and billing.
   - **Interaction**: Interfaces with the data access layer to retrieve or update data in the database.

### 3. **Data Access Layer**
   - **Technology**: JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
   - **Components**: 
     - **DAO (Data Access Objects)**: Encapsulate database interaction logic, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.
   - **Interaction**: Handles communication between the business logic layer and the MySQL database.

### 4. **Database Layer**
   - **Technology**: MySQL
   - **Components**: 
     - **Tables for various entities**: Such as `Patients`, `Doctors`, `Appointments`, `Bills`, etc.
   - **Functionality**: Stores all hospital-related data and ensures consistency through relational database structures.

### 5. **Security and Authentication**
   - **Technology**: Java security mechanisms, HTTP session management

   - **Components**: Role-based access control (e.g., admin, doctors, patients) to restrict system functionality based on user roles.
   - **Functionality**: Validates users and protects sensitive data, ensuring only authorized personnel can perform critical operations.

### 6. **Interaction Flow**
   1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the JSP interface, submitting forms or requesting data.
   2. **Request Handling**: The request is passed to Java servlets, which process the request using business logic.
   3. **Database Operations**: If necessary, the business logic interacts with the DAO to retrieve or update data in MySQL.
   4. **Response Generation**: The servlet forwards the response to the JSP, which displays the result back to the user.

This structure ensures a separation of concerns, maintaining modularity and scalability in the system.
