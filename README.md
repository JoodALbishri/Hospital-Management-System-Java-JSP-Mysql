### Detailed Explanation of System Components

1. **User Interface (UI)**: 
   - This is the front-facing part of the system where users interact. It includes:
     - **JSP Pages**: Dynamic web pages that display information and gather user input.
     - **HTML/CSS**: Define the structure and styling of the web pages, ensuring a user-friendly design.
     - **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity, enabling features like form validation and dynamic content updates.

2. **Controller Layer**: 
   - Acts as a mediator between the UI and the business logic. It consists of:
     - **Servlets**: Handle HTTP requests and responses, processing user input and directing it to the appropriate business logic.
     - **Request Handlers**: Specific components that manage routing requests to the relevant business logic methods.

3. **Business Logic Layer**: 
   - Contains the core functionalities of the system, including:
     - **Patient Management**: Logic for creating, updating, and retrieving patient records.
     - **Appointment Scheduling**: Manages the scheduling, rescheduling, and cancellation of appointments.
     - **Billing System**: Handles financial transactions, invoicing, and payment processing, ensuring accurate financial records.

4. **Data Access Layer**: 
   - Responsible for interacting with the database, including:
     - **DAO Classes**: Data Access Objects that perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on the database.
     - **Repository Interfaces**: Define the methods used for data access, promoting a clean separation of concerns.

5. **Database**: 
   - The backend storage solution for all persistent data, implemented with:
     - **MySQL**: A relational database that stores critical information, including:
       - **Patient Table**: Contains details about each patient.
       - **Staff Table**: Stores information about hospital staff members.
       - **Appointment Table**: Tracks all scheduled appointments.
